# Charmonium
Hypixel Skyblock Macro's
It kinda has everything; fishing, gemstone, rev, sven, foraging, ice walkers, and a few random qols (DONT TOUCH TERMS XD - i was too lazy to remove)

# Why?
To have fun basically. Also im stubborn and broke w/ at least 2 brain cells so I cooked this up to have my own macros to use. it works tbh, I mined 10b nw w/ gemstone macro, over 1.5b collection & no ban. Some stuff is glitchy bc im one person and ion got a clue what im doing. 
It worked out, kinda, I mean i learned (debatable) and worked with Java for the first time.
